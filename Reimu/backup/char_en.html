						<h3>
							Profile
						</h3>
							<img src="./img/stand_ENG.png" style="float:left;margin-right:15px;">
							The shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine.<br>
							She is a human who protects the border that divides the absurd and the reality.<br>
							She possesses an ability to fly in the air and exorcise evil spirits.<br>
							<br>
							Whenever a incident occurs, he immediately rushes to resolve it, even though most of the time he feels like it's a nuisance.<br>
							However, she never manages to get rid of all the disturbances around her.<br>
							Rather, it may be the case that she attracts disturbances to herself.<br>
						<h3>
							My Opinion of the Character
						</h3>
						<h4>
							Negative
						</h4>
							Reimu despite being the main character is very easy to play with, besides I don't like her very much, she doesn't have much mystery, it's basically "a problem arises, she comes and solves it".<br>
							<br>
							<b>--Opinion of IkuTronHD</b>
						<h4>
							Positive
						</h4>
							Even if I think badly of Reimu, she is very well worked out more for fighting at long distances, and maybe she gave up her voice for fun.<br>
							<br>

						<h3>
							Differences between "Touhou 12.3" and "Touhou 7.5".
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>The card system is different, there are some cards from Soku/UNL and IaMP but most of them are original, and some of them are very broken.</li>
							<li>Normal moves are not equal/identical to either Soku or IaMP in terms of frame data or speed.</li>

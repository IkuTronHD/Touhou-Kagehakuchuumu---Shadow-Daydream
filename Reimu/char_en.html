						<h3>
							Profile
						</h3>
							<img src="./img/stand_ENG.png">
							<br>
							The shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine.<br>
							She is a human who protects the border that divides absurdity and reality.<br>
							She possesses an ability to fly in the air and exorcise evil spirits.<br>
							<br>
							Whenever a disturbance occurs, she immediately rushes to resolve it, although most of the time she feels that it is a nuisance.<br>
							However, she never manages to get rid of all the disturbances around her.<br>
							Rather, it could be the case that she attracts disturbances to herself.<br>

									Reimu, despite being the protagonist, is very easy to play with, apart from that I don't like her very much, she doesn't have much mystery, it's basically "a problem arises, she comes and solves it."

									Although I think badly of Reimu, she is very well trained for fighting at long distances, and maybe she left her voice for fun.

						<h3>
							Differences between "Touhou 12.3" and "Touhou 7.5"
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>The card system is different, apart from the fact that there are some Soku/UNL and IaMP cards but most of them are original, apart from others that are very broken.</li>
							<li>Normal movements are not the same/identical to either Soku or IaMP in terms of frame data or speed.</li>
